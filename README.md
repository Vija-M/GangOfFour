Gang of Four Patterns
Homework is a practical part of the training. It's mission is to consolidate received knowledge from online course in practice:

Task: You are free to decide the context and task itself (e.g., create an inventory management system for various 2-d shapes) The solution must make use of at least 1 creational GoF pattern, 1 behavioral GoF pattern, and 1 structural GoF pattern The solution must use at least 4 non-creational GoF patterns in total

Implementation Guidelines: Create a GitHub repository for the assignment Donâ€™t use any input from the user at all. If you wish to achieve dynamic behavior, use random numbers All output should be printed to standard console output Keep it simple. Your goal is to demonstrate how to implement patterns for your solution, everything else is secondary
